# NodeRED CTF game

Run with
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Then go to the webpage on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and try to solve the challenges.

For challenges 1 through 3 (_Deck 4_), there is a Node-RED running on [http://localhost:1880](http://localhost:1880).

For challenge 4 (_Deck 5_), you use a separate Node-RED instance on [http://localhost:1881](http://localhost:1881).
